# Strava Visualisations
This repo is the working folder for the course assignment from Wan Ri Ho and Lucca Zachmann.

# Project idea
1. Get data from the Strava API :white_check_mark:
2. Build simple shiny app to visualise spatial tracks :white_check_mark: 
3. Publish the app and let loggers use it (:x: not yet achieved)

# Features
1. Data is called via online requests from [OpenStreetMap](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap) (no need to load any database)
2. App can be used anywhere in the world
3. English language only (can be easily extended)
4. Riding and running activities (other actives can easily be included)
